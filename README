The aim of this project is to construct a Simulator for an Out-of-order superscalar processor based on the Tomasulo's Algorithm. 
Only the dynamic scheduling mechanism is to be modeled i.e. perfect caches and perfect branch predictions are assumed.

The simulator will accept following arguments - 
./sim <S> <N> <tracefile>
Where, 
S: Scheduling Queue Size, 
N: peak fetch, dispatch and issue rate.
tracefile: Filename of the input trace.

The simulator will output following -
1) Timing information for every instruction - 
For every instruction, for each of the pipeline phases IF, ID, IS, EX & WB, the first cycle that the Instruction was in 
that phase and the number of cycles the instruction was in that phase should be displayed.
2) The microarchitecture configuration for a particular run.
3) Following Measurements - 
 1. Total number of instructions
 2. Total number of cycles to finish the program
 3. Average number of instructions completed per cycles (IPC)

The tracefile has multiple lines of following format - 
<PC> <operation type> <dest reg #> <src1 reg #> <src2 reg #>
